run_analysis.R is a script that will create the required tidy data set if run when the directory "UCI HAR Dataset" is present in the working directory. The data set will be stored as a data frame in the object FinalData. The needed packages are automatically loaded when running the script. The package "plyr" must be installed before running the script.
